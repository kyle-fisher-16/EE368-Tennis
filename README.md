# Notes!

SharedData/ is a synced collection of data which can be shared over git. This is a place to put images, videos, etc which are worth keeping on the actual repo.

UntrackedFiles/ is unsynced. You can put input/output data there with no limit on size, because it's untracked by git. Probably what we'll do is manually copy input video files into here (copied from Google Drive)
